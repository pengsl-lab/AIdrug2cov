# AIdrug2cov
A network representation learning-based methodology, termed AIdrug2cov, to discover drug mechanism and anti-inflammatory response for patients with COVID-19

# Data description
* Candidate targets of COVID-19: 45 targets of COVID-19 predicted AIdrug2cov.
* Candidate drugs of COVID-19: 25 agents of COVID-19 predicted AIdrug2cov.
* GO_Molecular_Function: GO enrichment analyses based on Enrichr web Server (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) for 45 potential targets of COVID-19.
* KEGG_2019_Human: KEGG enrichment analyses based on Enrichr web Server (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) for 45 potential targets of COVID-19.
* CMapscore: Connectivity map score based on up- and down-regulated genes of SARS patients for 2439 drug compounds.
